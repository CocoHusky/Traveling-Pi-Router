# Traveling Pi Router (AR9271 only)

This repository installs a travel-router stack for Raspberry Pi that **only supports Qualcomm Atheros AR9271 USB Wi‑Fi adapters using `ath9k_htc`**.

## Quick install

```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

The installer fails fast if AR9271/`ath9k_htc` is not detected.

## Find your dongle MAC

1. Plug in your AR9271 dongle.
2. Run:
   ```bash
   iw dev
   ```
   (or `ip link`)
3. Copy the MAC address of the USB Wi‑Fi interface.

## Edit config

```bash
sudo nano /etc/travelrouter/config.env
```

Change at least these values:
- `SSID`
- `PASSPHRASE`
- `AP_IFACE_MAC`
- `COUNTRY`

Default config generated by installer:

```env
SSID=TravelRouter
PASSPHRASE=changeme123
AP_IFACE_MAC=00:11:22:33:44:55
COUNTRY=US
WAN_IF=wlan0
LAN_IF=wlan1
LAN_CIDR=192.168.50.1/24
DHCP_START=192.168.50.20
DHCP_END=192.168.50.150
```

## Start/enable

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now travelrouter
```

If your interface name does not immediately become `LAN_IF` (`wlan1` by default), reboot once:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

## Verify

```bash
iw dev
ip a show wlan1
systemctl status travelrouter hostapd dnsmasq
cat /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases
```

Expected:
- `iw dev`: LAN interface is type `AP` and shows your SSID.
- `ip a show wlan1`: includes `192.168.50.1/24`.
- `systemctl status ...`: services are active/running.
- `dnsmasq.leases`: clients appear after connecting.

## Notes

- Interface naming is done via systemd `.link` using your configured `AP_IFACE_MAC` (`/etc/systemd/network/10-travelrouter.link`), not udev `NAME=` rules.
- If NetworkManager is installed, `LAN_IF` is marked unmanaged.
- If dhcpcd is installed, `denyinterfaces LAN_IF` is set.
- The AP config uses `nl80211` and a **fixed channel (`channel=6`)**; AR9271/`ath9k_htc` can be quirky with ACS/auto-channel selection.
- Scripts avoid logging your plaintext passphrase.

## Uninstall (optional)

```bash
sudo ./uninstall.sh
```

This removes installed service/scripts/link files and keeps `/etc/travelrouter/config.env` for reuse.
